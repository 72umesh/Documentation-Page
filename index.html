            <p>DaVinci Resolve integrates editing, compositing and motion graphics, color correction,audio recording and mixing, and finishing within a single, 
                easy to learn application. Theediting, compositing, grading, and audio tools found in DaVinci Resolve should be immediately familiar to experienced 
                artists who’ve used other applications, but they’re also approachable to folks who are new to post-production.</p>
            <p>Additionally, dedicated tools available for on-set workflows integrate tasks such as media duplication, shot and metadata organization, 
                and on-location look management into a complete toolset that lets you smoothly segue from the camera original media being acquired in the field
                 to the organization and use of that media in a wide variety of post‑production workflows with DaVinci Resolve at their heart.</p>
            <p>And you can go further, using the collaborative features of DaVinci Resolve to enable multiple artists, for example an editor, a colorist, 
                and assistants, to work together on the same timeline simultaneously, for the ultimate integrated workflow.</p>
            <p>Of course, no post-production professional works in a vacuum, and DaVinci Resolve makes it easy to work with other facilities by importing 
                projects and exporting project exchange formats and rendered or managed media among applications such as Apple’s Final Cut Pro X, 
                Adobe’s Premiere Pro, Avid’s Media Composer and Pro Tools, Autodesk’s Flame Premium, and many other applications via robust support 
                of XML, AAF, and EDL import and export workflows.</p>

            <p>It introduces the DaVinci Resolve user interface (UI), explaining where to find each group of features, and how the highly focused and tightly
                integrated Media, Edit,Fusion, Color, Fairlight, and Deliver pages work together to let you pursue nearly anypost‑production workflow you can
                imagine. After this brief tour, the rest of Part 1 of thismanual provides much more in‑depth information about project management,
                preferences, project settings, and other topics of general interest for getting started.</p>

                    <p>For most users, Project Manager is the first window you’ll see when you open DaVinci Resolve.
                        The Project Manager is a centralized interface for managing all projects belonging to the user who’s
                        currently logged in, whose name appears at the upper right-hand corner in a project title bar.</p>
                    <p>The Project Manager is also the place where you import and export projects to and from
                        DaVinci Resolve, whether you’re moving projects around from user to user, or moving projects from
                        one DaVinci Resolve workstation to another. Finally, the Project Manager also lets you organize the
                        databases that are used to manage everything in DaVinci Resolve using the Database Sidebar.</p>

                <article>
                    <p>DaVinci Resolve is divided into seven main pages of functionality, each of which facilitates a different
                        specialization of a typical post production workflow, and each of which can be accessed using buttons
                        at the very bottom of the DaVinci Resolve interface. These buttons are organized in order of workflow,
                        and they’re always available, letting you quickly switch between importing media, fast editing, detailed
                        editing, compositing, grading, audio mixing, and outputting your project in a structured manner.</p>

                <header class="t-medium">The Media Page</header>
                <article>
                    <p>The Media page is the primary interface for clip import, media management, and clip organization in
                        DaVinci Resolve. It’s central to the way DaVinci Resolve works that the source media used by a project
                        is organized separately from the project data that you import and manage in the Edit page. In this way,
                        you can manage and update the clips used by timelines in the current project with ease, switching
                        between offline and online media, reorganizing clips, and troubleshooting any problems that occur.</p>
                    <p>The Media page also contains much of the core functionality that will be used for on-set workflows,
                        and in the ingest, organizational, and sound-syncing steps of digital dailies workflows. This chapter
                        covers most of the functionality found in the Media page, including functions in detail that are
                        referenced throughout this manual.</p>
                    <p>The Media page is divided into six different areas, designed to make it easy to find, select, and work
                        with media in your project. Much of the functionality and most of the commands are found within the
                        contextual menus that appear when you right-click clips in the Library, File Browser, or Media Pool.</p>

                <article>
                    <p>The Cut page is a focused environment for fast editing. It’s useful in situations where you need to
                        quickly cut a news segment, build an episode of web content, edit a straightforward program,
                        experiment with multiple arrangements of a scene, or put together a first assembly edit.</p>
                    <p>The Cut page is also a good introductory editing interface for people who are new to editing, as it
                        presents a streamlined set of tools that are fast to learn and simple to use. Whatever your background,
                        you’ll find the Cut page to be a valuable addition to your editing experience in DaVinci Resolve.</p>

                <article>
                    <p>The Edit page exposes a source-record style NLE that incorporates many specialized features for both
                        creative editing and finishing. The Edit page is divided into three main regions: the browsers found at
                        the left, the Viewers at the top, and the Timeline at the bottom, all of which work together to let you
                        import, edit, and trim timelines with a flexible variety of tools and methods.</p>

                <article>
                    <p>The Fusion page is intended, eventually, to be a feature-complete integration of Blackmagic Design
                        Fusion, a powerful 2D and 3D compositing application with over thirty years of evolution serving the
                        film and broadcast industry, creating effects that have been seen in countless films and
                        television series.</p>
                    <p>Merged right into DaVinci Resolve with a newly updated user interface, the Fusion page makes it
                        possible to jump immediately from editing right into compositing, with no need to export media, relink
                        files, or launch another application to get your work done. Everything you need now lives right inside
                        DaVinci Resolve.</p>

                <article>
                    <p>The Color page is where you color correct, or grade, your program. It has all of the controls available
                        for manipulating color and contrast, reducing noise, creating limited secondary color corrections,
                        building image effects of different kinds, adjusting clip geometry, and making many other corrective
                        and stylistic adjustments. The Color page is divided into seven main areas that work together to let
                        you build a grade.</p>

            <section class="main-section" id="The_Fairlight_Page">
                <header class="t-medium">The Fairlight Page</header>
                <article>
                    <p>In single monitor mode, the Fairlight page is an optimized look at the audio tracks of your project, with
                        an expanded mixer and custom monitoring controls that make it easy to evaluate and adjust the levels
                        of your program in order to create a smooth and harmonious mix.</p>
                    <p>The Fairlight page differs in another unique respect from the Edit page Timeline, in that it supports
                        audio layering. Audio layering is a special audio editing mode that lets you superimpose multiple audio
                        clips in the same track, and whatever audio clip is on top dictates which audio will play. In a way, when
                        audio layering is enabled, superimposed audio clips are treated the same as superimposed video clips
                        that all have opacity set to 100%, with clips on top obscuring (or muting) clips underneath.</p>

                <article>
                    <p>Once you’ve finished grading your project, you need to either render it, or output it to tape to deliver it
                        to your client. This is where the Deliver page comes in. The Deliver page can be used both to output
                        digital deliverables, or to output tape, depending on which mode you enable. Either way, the Deliver
                        page is divided into five areas of functionality, each of which lets you set up a different part of a render
                        or output to tape.</p>
                    <p>The Deliver page is set up to let you queue a series of individual jobs, each of which can have different
                        settings, or be set up to render different parts of the Timeline. In this way, you can output multiple
                        deliverables, or re-render multiple areas of a timeline, as your needs require.</p>

            <p>The Media page is the primary interface for media import and clip organization in DaVinci Resolve. It’s also where all timelines that you edit in DaVinci Resolve or import from other applications are organized. While timelines and clips are both saved in the Media Pool, it’s central to the way DaVinci Resolve works that the source media used by a project is managed separately from your timelines. In this way, you can manage and update the clips used by timelines with ease, importing and reorganizing clips, switching between offline and online media, and troubleshooting any problems

                    <header class="t-small">The Media Storage Browser</header>
                    <p>The Media Storage browser lets you see all of the volumes connected to your workstation, browsing them for media that you want to preview and eventually import into your DaVinci Resolve project in one way or another. Whereas other applications rely on some sort of import dialog, DaVinci Resolve provides the Media page for doing complex media import tasks. To facilitate media import, the Media Storage browser is divided into two areas, the Volume List, and the Media Browser.</p>

                    <p>Both the Media and Edit pages have a Metadata Editor. When you select a clip in any area of the Media page, its metadata is displayed within the Metadata Editor. If you select multiple clips, only the last clip’s information appears. The Metadata Editor’s header contains uneditable information about the selected clip, including the file name, directory, duration, video codec, frame rate, resolution, audio codec, sample rate, and number of channels.</p>

                        audio meters are displayed that show the levels of audio in clips you’re playing. In Waveform mode,you can open audio clips side by side with video clips in the Viewer in order to sync them together
                        manually.</p>
                    <p>When set to Levels mode, you can check audio embedded within clips you’ve imported into the Media

                    <p>The Media Pool contains all video clips, audio clips, graphics, and other media that you import into
                        your project. You can create bins with which to organize all of this media, to make it easier to find what
                        you need quickly. These bins are opened via the bin drop-down at the upper left-hand corner.</p>
                    <p>Each piece of media you import, whether it’s video, audio, or graphics, appears as an individual clip
                        and can be selected, scrubbed for fast viewing, reorganized into bins, opened into the Viewer for
                        playback, or edited into a timeline using the edit buttons or via drag and drop.</p>

                    <p>The Viewer lets you see clips from the Media Pool, or clips in the Timeline, and has numerous controls
                        to control what you see and how things play.</p>
                    <p>The Viewer has four mode options. Which option is currently in use can be seen, and switched, by four

                    <p>The Different options are entered automatically by various actions (from left to right):</p>

                        playing in the current clip or in the Timeline as you play through the Viewer, via animated vertical bars
                        that are tinted to indicate how loud the levels are:</p>

                <header class="t-medium">The Timeline</header>
                <article>
                    <p>The word “timeline” refers both to an edited sequence of clips, which constitutes a program that is
                        stored in the Media Pool, and to the area of the Cut page interface where you can open this sequence
                        of clips to see its contents, and for playback and editing.</p>
                    <p>Timelines are created and stored in the Media Pool, along with all of your other clips. However, each
                        timeline is assembled and edited in what is sometimes referred to as the Timeline Editor. Different
                        pages of DaVinci Resolve show your timeline differently according to the special requirements of each
                        page focusing variously on different methods of editing, grading, compositing, and audio. </p>
                    <header class="t-small">Upper Timeline</header>
                    <p>The Upper Timeline always shows the entire program within the full width of your computer’s display.
                        The Upper Timeline’s playhead is always free, which makes it easy to use your pointer to scroll around
                        the entire program by dragging within the Timeline Ruler at top. This also serves as a visual reference
                        for keeping track of where you are in your program while you’re editing within the zoomed-in Lower
                        Timeline</p>
                    <header class="t-small">Lower Timeline</header>
                    <p>The zoomed in Lower Timeline (often referred to simply as “the Timeline”) shows you a close-up view
                        of the portion of the currently open timeline that immediately surrounds the playhead. The zoom level
                        is fixed; you cannot change it. The zoomed-in lower timeline is intended for detailed editing, but clips
                        can be dragged between the Timeline and Upper Timeline for fast reordering of clips across the entire
                        duration of your program.</p>

                 <p>The Bin list at the left shows a hierarchical list of bins used for organizing your media, which is also used to organize your timelines.

            <p>Generally speaking, “conforming” a project describes the process of importing a project exchange file from another post-production application, and automatically relinking each clip in the imported timeline to the high-quality media files each clip corresponds to.</p>
            <p>If you need to continue editing, color correct, or finish a project that was put together in another application, you can import via the EDL, AAF, or XML project exchange formats. When you go through the process of conforming a project, you use the imported project data to arrange the clips in the Media Pool into a timeline that
                constitutes the program that’s about to be graded.</p>

            <p>At times, you may need to import 3D geometry from applications like Blender, Cinema4D, or Maya.
                One of the formats you can use for importing 3D geometry is the Alembic file format. This file type is a
                3D scene interchange format that contains baked animation with its geometry. In other words, it
                eliminates the animation calculation times by embedding fixed, uneditable animation with 3D
                geometry. The animation is typically embedded using a point cache, which saves the dynamic data
                such as velocity after it has been calculated. Alembic objects can contain mesh geometry, cameras,
                points, UVs, normals, and baked animation.</p>

This release of DaVinci Resolve possesses our newest and most evolved professional color correction tools yet.

            <p>Subsequent chapters of this user manual cover the DaVinci Resolve grading tools in the
                Color page in great detail, but before getting into the specifics of color balancing and contrast
                adjustment, Power Windows, and Custom Curves, it’s important to step back and consider
                what these tools are for, and why you’re learning to use this application in the first place.</p>
